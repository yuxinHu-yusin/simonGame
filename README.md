The Simon Game is a front-end web application that challenges players to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds in the correct order. The game starts with a simple sequence and increases in complexity with each round, adding an additional step to the sequence.

Key features of the Simon Game Project:
Four Buttons/Colors: The game typically involves four large buttons, each with a distinct color and sound (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow).
Random Sequence Generation: In each round, the game adds a new random color to the sequence, which the player must remember and repeat.
Player Interaction: The player uses mouse clicks (or touch, depending on the platform) to repeat the color sequence.
Feedback: If the player repeats the sequence correctly, they proceed to the next round. If they make a mistake, the game ends or provides feedback (like a sound or visual signal).
Scoring System: The game may keep track of how many rounds the player successfully completes, with the difficulty increasing as the sequence lengthens.
